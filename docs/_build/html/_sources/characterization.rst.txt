Protein Characterization and Property Prediction
================================================

Overview
--------

Protein characterization involves the computational and experimental determination of various physicochemical, biochemical, and biological properties of proteins. Understanding these properties is essential for insights into protein stability, function, interaction potential, and suitability for therapeutic or industrial applications.

Why Characterization Matters
----------------------------

- ðŸ”¬ **Stability Assessment:** Predicts thermal stability, solubility, and aggregation propensity which impact protein formulation and shelf-life.
- ðŸ§ª **Functionality Insight:** Helps infer enzymatic activity, binding affinities, and structural dynamics.
- ðŸ§¬ **Mutational Effects:** Evaluates how amino acid substitutions alter protein behavior and stability.
- ðŸ’Š **Drug Design Support:** Guides selection of druggable targets and design of stable therapeutic proteins or antibodies.

Qubio integrates several advanced tools that analyze protein properties computationally, enabling rapid screening and prioritization before wet-lab experiments.
