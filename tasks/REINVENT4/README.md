REINVENT 4
==========


Description
-----------

REINVENT is a molecular design tool for de novo design, scaffold hopping,
R-group replacement, linker design, molecule optimization, and other small
molecule design tasks.  REINVENT uses a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) algorithm to generate optimized molecules compliant with a user defined
property profile defined as a multi-component score.  Transfer Learning (TL)
can be used to create or pre-train a model that generates molecules closer
to a set of input molecules. 

A paper describing the software has been published as Open Access in the
Journal of Cheminformatics:
[Reinvent 4: Modern AIâ€“driven generative molecule design](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13321-024-00812-5?utm_source=rct_congratemailt&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=oa_20240221&utm_content=10.1186/s13321-024-00812-5).

Requirements
------------

REINVENT is being developed on Linux and supports both GPU and CPU.  The Linux
version is fully validated.  REINVENT on Windows and MacOSX supports
both GPU and CPU but is only partially tested on these platforms and therefore
support is limited.

The code is written in Python 3 (>= 3.10).  The list of
dependencies can be found in the repository (see also Installation below).

A GPU is not strictly necessary but strongly recommended for performance
reasons especially for transfer learning and model training.  Reinforcement
learning (RL) requires the computation of scores where most scoring
components run on the CPU.  Thus, a GPU is less important for RL (depending
on how much time is spent on the CPU).

Note that if no GPU is installed in your computer the code will run on the
CPU automatically.  REINVENT [supports](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) NVIDIA GPUs and also some AMD GPUs.
For most design tasks a memory of about 8 GiB for both CPU main memory and
GPU memory is sufficient.


Installation
------------

1. Clone this Git repository.
1. Create a Python environment and install a compatible version of Python, for example with [Conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html) (other virtual environments like Docker, pyenv, or the system package manager work too).
    ```shell
    conda create --name reinvent4 python=3.10
    conda activate reinvent4
    ```
1. Change directory to the repository and install all dependencies.  You will need to set the right processor type, see [PyTorch versions](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Linux supports CUDA (e.g. "cu124"), ROCm (e.g. "rocm6.2.4")  and CPU. Windows supports CUDA and CPU.  MacOSX only supports CPU (use "mac" as processor type!). Optionally, you can select dependencies "openeye" (for ROCS; you need to obtain your own license), "isim" for similarity tracking in TensorBoard or "none" to skip all.  The default is installation of "all" dependencies.  See the help text from the install script for details.
    ```shell
    python install.py --help
    python install.py cu124  # or rocm6.2.4, cpu, mac, etc.
    ```
1. Test the tool. The installer has added a script `reinvent` to your PATH.
    ```shell
    reinvent --help
    ```

Basic Usage
-----------

REINVENT is a command line tool and works principally as follows
```shell
reinvent -l sampling.log sampling.toml
```

This writes logging information to the file `sampling.log`.  If you wish to write
this to the screen, leave out the `-l sampling.log` part. `sampling.toml` is the
configuration file.  The main user format is [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) as it tends to be more
use friendly.  JSON can be used too, add `-f json`, but a specialised editor is
recommended as the format is very sensitive to minor changes.

Sample configuration files for all run modes are
located in `configs/toml` in the repository and file paths in these files would need to be
adjusted to your local installation.  In particular, ready made prior models are
located in `priors` and you would choose a model and the
appropriate run mode depending on the research problem you are trying to address.
There is additional information in `configs/toml` in several `*.md` files with
instructions on how to configure the TOML file.  Internal priors can be referenced with a
dot notation (see `reinvent/prior_registry.py`).


Tutorials / `Jupyter` notebooks
-------------------------------

Basic instructions can be found in the comments in the config examples in `configs/toml`.

Notebooks are provided in the `notebooks/` directory.  Please note that we
provide the notebooks in jupytext "light script" format.  To work with the light
scripts you will need to install jupytext.  A few other packages will come in handy too.

```shell
pip install jupytext mols2grid seaborn
```

The Python files in `notebooks/` can then be converted to a notebook e.g.

```shell
jupytext -o Reinvent_demo.ipynb Reinvent_demo.py
```


Updating dependencies
---------------------

Update the lock files with [pip-tools](https://pypi.org/project/pip-tools/) (please, do not edit the files manually):
```shell
pip-compile --extra-index-url=https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121 --extra-index-url=https://pypi.anaconda.org/OpenEye/simple --resolver=backtracking pyproject.toml
```
To update a single package, use `pip-compile --upgrade-package somepackage`
(see the documentation for pip-tools).


Scoring Plugins
---------------

The scoring subsystem uses a simple plugin mechanism (Python
[native namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages)).  If you
wish to write your own plugin, follow the instructions below.
There is no need to touch any of the REINVENT code. The public
repository contains a [contrib](https://github.com/MolecularAI/REINVENT4/tree/main/contrib/reinvent_plugins/components) directory with some useful examples.

1. Create `/top/dir/somewhere/reinvent\_plugins/components` where `/top/dir/somewhere` is a convenient location for you.
1. Do **not** place a `__init__.py` in either `reinvent_plugins` or `components` as this would break the mechanism.  It is fine to create normal packages within `components` as long as you import those correctly.
1. Place a file whose name starts with `comp_*` into `reinvent_plugins/components`.   Files with different names will be ignored i.e. not imported. The directory will be searched recursively so structure your code as needed but directory/package names must be unique.
1. Tag the scoring component class(es) in that file with the @add\_tag decorator.  More than one component class can be added to the same *comp\_* file. See existing code.
1. Tag at most one dataclass for parameters in the same file, see existing code.  This is optional.
1. Set or add `/top/dir/somewhere` to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable or use any other mechanism to extend `sys.path`.
1. The scoring component should now automatically be picked up by REINVENT.


Unit and Integration Tests 
--------------------------

This is primarily for developers and admins/users who wish to ensure that the
installation works.  The information here is not relevant to the practical use
of REINVENT.  Please refer to _Basic Usage_ for instructions on how to use the 
`reinvent` command.

The REINVENT project uses the `pytest` framework for its tests.  Before you run
them you first have to create a configuration file for the tests.

In the project directory, create a `config.json` file in the `configs/` directory.
You can use the example config `example.config.json` as a base.  Make sure that
you set `MAIN_TEST_PATH` to a non-existent directory.  That is where temporary
files will be written during the tests.  If it is set to an existing directory,
that directory will be removed once the tests have finished.

Some tests require a proprietary OpenEye license.  You have to set up a few
things to make the tests read your license.  The simple way is to just set the
`OE_LICENSE` environment variable to the path of the file containing the
license.  

Once you have a configuration and your license can be read, you can run the tests.

```
$ pytest tests --json /path/to/config.json --device cuda
```
